# Week 3

## Week 3 describtion
This time for week 3 before begining with my tasks I got some feedback on the website designs from my other teamates and the scrumaster on how they felt on the frontend development for week 3 and they said that the design was well made and looked good. After getting feedback on the frontend development I began to create a register and login this is because one of the things i got as feedback was to add a register and login page while they create the backend side for the register and login, afterwareds I create a map page and inplemented the backend developmet to the frontend. Alittle way into week 3 we found some issues with the api so we though to help the client become aware of the issues we should write down and keep a list of all issues that we find with the api.
